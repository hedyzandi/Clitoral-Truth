				The clitoris has been dismissed, undervalued, unexplored, and 
misunderstood for hundreds of years, but the truth is out there, and 
internationally celebrated sex educator Rebecca Chalker has found it. In
                  <em>The Clitoral Truth</em>, Chalker offers the only mainstream, in-depth 
exploration devoted solely to women's genital anatomy and sexual 
response. Women readers everywhere--be they straight, gay, or 
bisexual--will learn about the countless sexual sensations and discover 
how to enhance their sexual responses in a more concrete way than ever 
before. Enhanced with personal accounts, comprehensive illustrations, 
and a thorough appendix of female sexuality resources, this book helps 
women and their partners understand and expand their sexual potential 
and work toward becoming independent sexual beings. </p><br>
