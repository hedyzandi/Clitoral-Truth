        <p>People who think that women&rsquo;s sexuality is second rate.</p>
        <p>Five reasons that women&rsquo; sexuality is equivalent to men&rsquo;s:</p>
        <ol>
<li class="licontent">  1. The complete clitoris has 18 or so parts:  a few more than the penis!</li>
<li class="licontent">  2. Women can ejaculate:  a little or a lot, often multiple times, and <br> often more than men!</li>
<li class="licontent">  3. Women can have multiple orgasms, most men can only have one <br>until a recovery period.</li>
<li class="licontent">  4. Women&rsquo;s sexual fantasies are as hot and intense as men&rsquo;s.</li>
<li class="licontent">  5. Women have orgasms in their sleep, just like men do.</li></ol>
